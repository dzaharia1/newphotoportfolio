Slants of mist that hazard these building-tops shimmer and mock the unending squabble of lights below. And along the crevices and cracks between the spires are people. Fucking masses of people shouldering through the din. Even after two weeks, one realizes they were so bedazzled by the intricacy of the place’s texture, that they’ve come away not understanding what the fuck any of it was about.",
